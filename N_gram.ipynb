Since we all know what \"Pretty Baby\" is about, one is to assume the child is watching some sexual act with curiosity. Actually, it\\'s just the opposite. This is writer-director Louis Malle\\'s clever way of laughing at the viewer, saying \"You have the dirty mind, not I.\" It\\'s a very smart way to begin to the picture, but little else occupied my mind after it got going. Why would Keith Carradine\\'s colorless older man want to marry a pubescent prostitute? Nobody here is saying, especially not Carradine (who has one sullen expression to express every emotion). The photography and background scoring are gorgeous, however the story and characters provide no passion, no emotion. The film is like a stylish painting, but one full of dullards. *1/2 from ****', \"i quite enjoyed this film. the only problem i had with it was that i wanted to see more of gina mckee's character explored - i think all the characters were spread a little thin and it could have been better if there was more focus to fewer characters. mckee was the highlight of the film (she often is) and her storyline was especially good.  <nl>  <nl> overall i thought the family dynamics were great - in a horrifying way. the parents were terribly distressing. i found the brother storyline slightly confusing and unnecessary. i would like to have known more about him or nothing at all. <nl>  <nl> anyway, i thought it was a decent film, worth seeing by all means.\"]\n"
